# rts-project
Real-time scheduler for multi-criticality systems, with mutual exclusion resource access protocol. Uses EDF-VD and DFP algorithms. Look at the tests structure at the folder `tests` for more info about how to use it. Test generator is also included.

First install the requirements (perferably in a venv) with the below command:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start the simulation with:
```bash
python3 src/scheduler.py
```

Enjoy!
